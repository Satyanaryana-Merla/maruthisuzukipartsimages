This Django project serves as a comprehensive platform for users to explore and purchase automotive parts. Leveraging Django's powerful features, the project incorporates various components:

1. **Models**: Utilizing Django's ORM, the project defines models such as `Products`, `CarModel`, and `Variant` to represent different aspects of the automotive parts ecosystem. These models facilitate the organization and retrieval of data related to products, car models, and their variants.

2. **Views**: Django views handle user requests, process data, and render HTML templates. Views are implemented for functionalities like displaying product details, searching for products, registering and logging in/out users, and enabling users to contact support.

3. **Templates**: HTML templates provide the user interface for the application. Templates are used to render dynamic content, including product listings, registration forms, login pages, and contact forms. They ensure a seamless and interactive user experience.

4. **Static and Media Files**: Static files, including CSS, JavaScript, and images, are served to enhance the user interface and functionality. Media files, such as product images, are stored and served to users to provide visual representations of products.

5. **Deployment on AWS**: The project is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure accessibility and scalability. Leveraging AWS's infrastructure, the application is hosted securely, allowing users to access it from anywhere with an internet connection.

This project showcases my proficiency in Django development, encompassing database modeling, user authentication, form handling, and front-end development. Deployed on AWS, it demonstrates my ability to deploy web applications using cloud services for optimal performance and reliability.This Django project serves as a comprehensive platform for users to explore and purchase automotive parts.
